Much of this code was originally adapted from Universal Electricity, with thanks to the Calclavia and the rest of the Universal Electricity development team.

Over time, it has evolved into something more specific to Galacticraft's needs.

This code is meant for internal use in Galacticraft and NOT meant to be used as a general purpose electricity library.
